type="submit"
          onSubmit={register}


body > iframe {
	display: none;
  }

  This doesn't help versions "react": "^18.2.0"   "react-router-dom": "^6.13.0"
And also I found error in homepage line "homepage": "https://Xardesso.github.io/DAPP-identity-management",Error :

    `Problems loading reference 'vscode://schemas/settings/configurationDefaults': Unable to load schema from 'vscode://schemas/settings/configurationDefaults': cannot open vscode://schemas/settings/configurationDefaults.
